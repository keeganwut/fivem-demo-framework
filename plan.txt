I'll make a simple framework that handles mock character data as if it were a real server environment.
We need to have a character selection (char-select),
character creation (char-create)
and a job or two do in-game when you select a character to accrue money for the session.

char-select structure:
- First screen you'll see on log-in and have a button where you can click to make a new/first character.
- Fetch player's character(s) from char-create in a secure method.
- Allow the player to select one of their characters to play or delete with a basic UI.
- Spawn player after character is made.

char-create structure:
- Have basic information like: Require a first and last name. Allow optional info like a background for the player's personal use.
- After character info is made send the player back to char-select with the updated list of characters.

Basic Jobs:
- After a character is made and the player selects to play one, spawn them near a hot dog stand where they can sell food to NPCs.
- Allow the checking of player balance by going to an ATM. May or may not be a basic UI that just shows the amount.
